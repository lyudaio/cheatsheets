### Common Vulnerabilities

| Security Vulnerability                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SQL Injection                                | Attackers inject malicious SQL statements into a web application to bypass security measures and access sensitive data stored in the database.                                                                                             |
| Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)                   | Attackers inject malicious scripts into a web application, which can then execute in the context of the user's browser. This can lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, and other types of attacks.                                      |
| Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)            | Attackers exploit the trust that a website has in a user's browser by tricking them into sending forged requests to the website. These requests can cause the website to perform unintended actions, such as changing the user's password. |
| Broken Authentication and Session Management | Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the authentication and session management mechanisms of a web application to gain access to sensitive information or functionality without proper authorization.                                      |
| Unvalidated Input                            | Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in a web application's input validation mechanisms to execute arbitrary code or perform unauthorized actions.                                                                                        |
| Insecure Direct Object References            | Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in a web application's access controls to access sensitive data or functionality that they should not have access to.                                                                                |
| Security Misconfiguration                    | Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in a web application's configuration to gain unauthorized access or perform unauthorized actions.                                                                                                    |
| Insufficient Logging and Monitoring          | Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in a web application's logging and monitoring mechanisms to cover their tracks and evade detection.                                                                                                  |
