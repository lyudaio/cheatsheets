# From SysAdmins to DevOps/SRE

## Introduction

The System Administrator (SysAdmin) role has evolved over the years to more dynamic roles such as DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), which integrate software development and IT operations. This evolution is largely driven by the need for speed, efficiency, and scalability in today's fast-paced technology landscape.

## Traditional SysAdmins

Traditional SysAdmins are responsible for installing, supporting, and maintaining servers or other computer systems, and planning for and responding to service outages and other problems.

Key features of SysAdmins:

- Typically work in silos separate from the development team.
- Mostly reactive, responding to issues as they occur.
- Manual configuration and patching of systems.
- Little to no automation.
- Difficulty in scaling operations.

## DevOps/SRE

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) with the goal to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

SRE is a discipline that incorporates aspects of software engineering and applies them to infrastructure and operations problems to create scalable and highly reliable software systems.

Key features of DevOps/SRE:

- Close collaboration between development and operations teams.
- Proactive approach, with a focus on automation to prevent issues.
- Infrastructure as code (IaC), allowing for scalability and consistency.
- Continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
- Shared responsibility for the production environment.
- Emphasis on monitoring and observability to prevent issues.

## Why SysAdmins Are Becoming Obsolete

The traditional SysAdmin role is becoming obsolete due to several factors:

- **Speed and efficiency**: DevOps and SRE practices focus on automation and CI/CD, allowing for faster and more efficient development cycles.
- **Scalability**: Traditional SysAdmin methods don't scale well for large systems. DevOps/SRE practices such as IaC allow for better scalability.
- **Reactivity vs Proactivity**: SysAdmins typically react to issues as they occur, whereas DevOps/SREs aim to proactively prevent issues with practices like automated testing and monitoring.
- **Silos**: SysAdmins often work in separate silos from developers, leading to communication and collaboration issues. DevOps/SRE breaks down these silos.

## Transitioning from SysAdmin to DevOps/SRE

For SysAdmins looking to transition into a DevOps or SRE role:

- Learn automation tools and scripting languages.
- Gain experience with CI/CD pipelines.
- Familiarize yourself with cloud platforms and services.
- Understand the principles of IaC.
- Develop a deep understanding of system architecture and networking.
- Learn about monitoring, logging, and observability tools.
