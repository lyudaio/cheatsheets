# Defense in Depth

## Introduction

Defense in Depth is a strategy used in cybersecurity where multiple layers of security controls (defense) are placed throughout an information technology (IT) system. Its intent is to manage risk with diverse defensive strategies, so if one layer of defense turns out to be inadequate, another layer of defense hopefully prevents a full breach.

## Key Principles

### Layered Security

Employ multiple layers of security measures so if one mechanism fails, others are already in place to prevent an attack.

### Redundancy

Have multiple systems that can do the same task. If one system fails, others can take over.

### Diversity

Use security controls from different vendors to minimize the impact of a single vulnerability across multiple systems.

### Obscurity

Keep details of the environment and security controls undisclosed to add an extra layer of protection.

### People, Processes, and Technology

Defense in depth is not just about technology but also includes people and processes.

## Practical Implementation

### Network Segmentation

Separate the network into segments to contain potential attacks and prevent lateral movement.

### Firewalls

Use firewalls to control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organizationâ€™s previously established security policies.

### Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems

Monitor network traffic for malicious activities or policy violations and report it to a management station.

### Antivirus Software

Help protect against malware which can be used to gain unauthorized access to a system.

### Regular Patching

Keep all systems, applications, and security controls updated with the latest patches.

### Two-Factor Authentication

Use two or more different types of credentials for authentication to add an extra layer of security.

### User Training

Train users about security best practices and how to spot potential attacks, like phishing.

### Regular Auditing and Logging

Monitor and log all activities on the network and regularly audit these logs.

### Incident Response Plan

Have a plan in place to respond effectively to security incidents.
