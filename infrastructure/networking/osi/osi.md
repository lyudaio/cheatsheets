# OSI Model Cheatsheet

## OSI Model

The OSI model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system, enabling different systems to communicate with each other. It has seven layers, each providing specific services that contribute to the overall communication process. The seven layers, from top to bottom, are as follows:

## 7. Application Layer

- Provides network services to end-user applications
- Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS
- Protocols: Telnet, FTP, HTTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP4, SNMP, DNS

## 6. Presentation Layer

- Converts data between the application and network formats
- Examples: Encryption, compression, ASCII, EBCDIC
- Protocols: SSL, TLS

## 5. Session Layer

- Provides session management functions
- Examples: Connection management, authentication, authorization
- Protocols: NetBIOS, SSH

## 4. Transport Layer

- Provides end-to-end transport services, such as reliable data transfer and flow control
- Examples: TCP, UDP
- Protocols: TCP, UDP

## 3. Network Layer

- Provides logical addressing and routing services
- Examples: IP, ICMP
- Protocols: IP, ICMP, ARP

## 2. Data Link Layer

- Provides reliable data transfer between network entities
- Examples: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, ATM
- Protocols: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Frame Relay, HDLC

## 1. Physical Layer

- Defines the physical characteristics of the communication medium
- Examples: Cables, connectors, electrical currents
- Protocols: RS-232, V.35

Each layer depends on the layer below it to provide services and uses the layer above it to provide services.
